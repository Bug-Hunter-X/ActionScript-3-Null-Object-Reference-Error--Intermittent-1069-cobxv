The following ActionScript 3 code attempts to access a property of an object that is null or undefined. This results in a runtime error:  1069: Property not found on null object reference.  This error can be particularly tricky to track down because the faulty object might not always be null, only sometimes, making it harder to reproduce consistently. 

```actionscript
// Example code causing the error:

myObject.myProperty = "someValue";

// ... later in code ...
trace(myObject.myProperty);
```

The issue occurs when `myObject` is not initialized or becomes null before the second line executes.
