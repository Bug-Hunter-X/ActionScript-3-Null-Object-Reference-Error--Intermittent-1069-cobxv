The solution involves adding null checks before accessing the object property to prevent the error:

```actionscript
//Corrected code
if (myObject != null && myObject.hasOwnProperty("myProperty")) {
  myObject.myProperty = "someValue";
}

// ... later in the code ...
if (myObject != null && myObject.hasOwnProperty("myProperty")) {
  trace(myObject.myProperty);
} else {
  trace("myObject or myProperty is null");
}
```

This revised code explicitly checks if `myObject` is not null and if the property `myProperty` exists before attempting to access it.  The `hasOwnProperty()` method ensures that `myProperty` actually exists as a property of `myObject`, preventing errors if an unexpected property is used. The `else` block handles the scenario gracefully by providing a message if the object or property is null.  This is significantly more robust than the original code and avoids the runtime error.
