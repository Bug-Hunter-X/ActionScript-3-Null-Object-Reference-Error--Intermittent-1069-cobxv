# ActionScript 3 Null Object Reference Error: Intermittent 1069

This repository demonstrates an uncommon ActionScript 3 bug involving intermittent null object reference errors (Error #1069). The error occurs inconsistently, making it challenging to debug. The repository includes the buggy code and its solution.

## Bug Description

The ActionScript code attempts to access a property of an object that might be null or undefined under certain circumstances. This leads to an Error #1069: `Property not found on null object reference`.

## Bug Solution

The solution involves adding robust null checks before accessing object properties, ensuring the object is properly initialized and preventing the error from occurring.
